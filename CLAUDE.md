## How I expect you to write code

**No shortcuts. "Simple" never means "sloppy."** A small diff that hardcodes,
duplicates, or skips a test isn't simpler — it's deferred cost.

1. **Fix causes, not symptoms.** Find the root cause before fixing. If you're
   applying a workaround, say so explicitly and explain why. Never swallow an
   exception or silence an error to make a problem disappear.

2. **Think about consequences.** Before changing shared or widely-used code,
   trace its callers and the invariants they rely on. A fix that's locally
   correct but breaks something elsewhere — now or later — is not a fix.

3. **SOLID, sensibly.** One responsibility per class/widget/function. Separate
   pure logic from I/O so it can be tested. Inject dependencies that cross a
   boundary so they're mockable. Don't add abstractions for things that don't
   cross a boundary.

4. **DRY about knowledge, not appearance.** Don't duplicate a rule or decision.
   Code that merely looks similar but changes for different reasons stays
   separate. When unsure, prefer duplication over a premature/wrong abstraction.

5. **No hardcoded values.** No magic numbers or strings inline — give them
   names. Environment/tenant/feature-specific values go in typed config in
   application code, never scattered literals, never the database.

6. **Readable & maintainable.** Clear names, short flat functions, early
   returns over deep nesting. Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Match the
   existing style of the file you're editing.

7. **Testable, and prove it.** Ship a test for behavior you add or change. If
   something is hard to test, that's a design smell — restructure until it
   isn't. "Works but can't be tested" means it isn't done.

A change is done only when: the cause (not a symptom) is fixed, no new hardcoded
values, a test covers it, and the analyzer/formatter are clean.
